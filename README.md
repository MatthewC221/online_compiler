# Online Compiler

This was a side project that was going to act as an online compiler.
The thought eventually was to make it a platform for learning where
exercises could be put.

I thought since I worked on it I might as well show it here.

## Functionality
**A pseudo-IDE for Python language**
- Command line arguments
- Standard output / standard error displayed
- Limited execution time

## Demo
